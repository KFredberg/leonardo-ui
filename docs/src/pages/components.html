<div class="component">
  <h1>Components</h1>
	<p>The current components of Leonardo UI are listed in the navigation menu. Components support RTL by default
    and most components are accessible. For the components requiring JS, there is a "JS" tab in the code examples.
  </p>
  <p>Components marked as "Experimental" are less stable. These components can still be used, but their API:s are subject to change more often than other components.
    Components marked as "Deprecated" should not be used and may be removed in a future version.</p>
  <h2>BEM</h2>
  <p><a href="http://getbem.com/">BEM</a> (Block Element Modifier) is used for class names which is why you will see classes like "lui-button--rounded" and "lui-button__icon".
    One exception from the BEM style has been made and that's the quite general "lui-active", "lui-disabled" etc. classes which do not contain the
    prefix of the component.</p>
